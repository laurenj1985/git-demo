Each multiple-choice quiz problem is based on a "root question," from which the system generates different correct and incorrect choices each time you take the quiz. Thus, you can test yourself on the same material multiple times. We strongly urge you to continue testing on each topic until you complete the quiz with a perfect score at least once. Simply click the "Reset" button at the bottom of the page for a new variant of the quiz.
